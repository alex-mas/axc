# axc
A library that offers a variety of react components written in typescript.

The scope of this project is not to provide something like bootstrap, but to create a suite of components that behave as they should, leaving the styling to the specific project in which they are deployed.


## Installation

```shell
    npm install @axc/react-components --save
```

## Examples

You can see the components in action in the [Storybook](https://alex-mas.github.io/react-components/storybook)

## Documentation

You can check the documentation of all components in the following link
[Documentation page](https://alex-mas.github.io/react-components/)

Documentation generated by [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/)


## Styling components
To style the components you have to override the styles defined on the base classes


## Stack used
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) to build the styles
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) to test the components
