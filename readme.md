# axc
A library that offers a variety of react components written in typescript.

The scope of this project is not to provide something like bootstrap, but to create a suite of components that behave as they should, leaving the styling to the specific project in which they are deployed.


## Installation

```shell
    npm install @axc/react-components --save
```

## Usage

```javascript
    // with webpack
    import I18String from '@axc/react-components/display/i18string';
    import MemoryRouter from '@axc/react-components/navigation/memoryRouter';
    const Component = ()=>{
        return(
            <MemoryRouter></MemoryRouter>
        )
    }
```

## Examples

You can see the components in action in the [Storybook](https://alex-mas.github.io/react-components/storybook)

## Documentation

You can check the documentation of all components in the following link
[Documentation page](https://alex-mas.github.io/react-components/)

## Current components
- Provided components have some basic styles required for the element, such as dropdown floating elements, etc. But they are suposed to be style independent and allow you to     provide your custom styles via className or appending rules to the element css class


### I18n system
A I18n context provider and a I18String that consumes the provided context, allowing you to define traductions and provide them dynamically to your app.

### Modal 
When open it renders the contents above an overlay, it has harcoded fade transitions between open and closed states. Use cases can be: Dialogs, loading spinners, etc...

### Router 
Basic router to be extended, it implements a default strategy and the hooks for custom routing strategies.

### MemoryRouter
Router that implements a strategy based on a data structure similar to browser history(IMPORTANT: it doesn't edit or use the actual window location) and renders the children who's "path" prop matches partially/totally the active route.


#### Auxiliary MemoryRouter components
They are intended to be used inside a MemoryRouter, as they are history context consumers

##### MemoryRoute
Renders the provided component/children and bootstraps history and route properties into it

##### MemoryLink 
On click pushes the provided location into MemoryRouter's history.

### Carousel
Renders a container with the provided children and with two buttons to switch the active child

### LinkedCarousel
like carousel, but also renders a link to each child in the form of several circle icons

### TabContainer
Renders the active child and a button for each child.

### Dialog 
Extends modal, renders the given title, description and options inside a modal and implements hooks to listen for onClick events on the options.

### TypeWriter
Renders the text as if was being typed by a human. 

### AutoComplete
Costumizable input tag that implements the logic to display suggestions and the hooks to customize how those are obtained/managed

### Countdown
Component that has two modes, in one you set the time and in the other it counts down to 0 from the specified time, when it ends it calls provided function(if any)

### Stopwatch
Component that renders a stopwatch and two buttons to pause/start and reset it, by default starts counting from 0 but a custom starting amount can be specified via the start prop(numeric value in seconds)

### Prompts
Costumizable prompt system that allows connected components to trigger prompts and(asyncrhonously) parse the results inside the same function call.


## Styling components
To style the components i've set up the css classes in most of the elements, so you can just require the component styles and build up on that
I might switch to css in js in the future to make it simpler to use the components.

## TODO
List of components that I will probably implement

- Toggable icons (like google/facebook widgets)
- Formsabstraction
- Animation components -> FadeIn/FadeOut/etc... 
- Draggable/resizable containers
- Parallax background
- Image that on focus zooms in
- WYSIWYG editor / markup editor
- Pagination
- Component that sticks to the edge of the page when you its original position falls out of the page.
- Some loaders/spinners
- Data grid
- Calendar
- Wrapper of graphjs for simplicty
- Progress bars


## Folder structure

- dist: where the compiled/transpile code is generated
- src: where the source of the components and styles live
- tasks: folder where task scripts are located
- tests: where unit/e2e tests live, also there's a test project to play around with the componentss


## Stack used
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) to build the styles
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) to test the components
